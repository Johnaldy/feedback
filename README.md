# Partner Engagement Feedback System

A system for collecting, tracking, and analyzing customer feedback on partner-delivered engagements.

## Overview

This repository implements a feedback collection and analysis system using GitHub's native features:
- **Issue Templates** for structured feedback collection
- **GitHub Actions** for automatic CSAT calculation and processing
- **GitHub Projects** for visualization and analysis

## How It Works

1. Partners collect feedback from customers after engagements
2. Partners submit feedback using the standardized issue template
3. GitHub Actions automatically calculate CSAT scores and apply labels
4. Feedback data is visualized in the GitHub Project board
5. Weekly reminders are sent for outstanding feedback collection

## Getting Started

### For Partners Submitting Feedback

1. Go to [Submit New Feedback](https://github.com/johnaldy/partner_feedback/issues/new?template=partner-feedback.yml)
2. Fill out all required fields with the customer feedback data
3. Submit the issue

### For Team Members Analyzing Feedback

1. View all feedback in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/johnaldy/partner_feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afeedback)
2. Use the [Project board](https://github.com/johnaldy/partner_feedback/projects) for visualization and analysis
3. Filter feedback by partner, engagement type, or CSAT score using labels

## Metrics Collected

The feedback system collects the following metrics:
- Partner Name
- Date Completed
- Engagement Type
- Engagement Name
- Engagement Status
- Number of Responses Received
- AVG Overall Customer Satisfaction (1-5 scale)
- AVG Quality of Work/Material (1-5 scale)

- AVG Impact/Value of Service (1-5 scale)
- Vertical (AMER, EMEA, APAC, etc.)
- Customer Suggestions/Comments
- Recommendations for GitHub
- Suggested Add-on Products
- CSAT Score (calculated automatically)

## CSAT Score Calculation

The CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score is calculated as the average of four metrics:
1. Overall Satisfaction
2. Quality of Work/Material
3. Effectiveness of Communication
4. Impact/Value of Service

Scores are categorized as:
- **Excellent**: 4.5 - 5.0
- **Good**: 4.0 - 4.49
- **Average**: 3.0 - 3.99
- **Needs Attention**: Below 3.0

## Implementation Details

This system uses the following GitHub features:
